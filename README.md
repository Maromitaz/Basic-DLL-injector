# Basic DLL injector
Hello, this is my attempt on making a basic DLL injector without a fancy GUI, just a console.

## How to compile
The compilation must be in Release x86, didn't test on x64.
Works on version C++ 14 Standard.

## How to use it
The first thing that you must write in the console is the name of the process.
The second thing is the name of the dll, it searches for the dll in the same directory that the injector is.

## Why does it take too long to inject?
You've probably didn't type correctly the proccess name.
